# Hi there, I'm Martin Humlund Clausen 👋

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhc) • [Blog](https://dev.to/martinhc)

👋 I'm a software generalist who writes (mostly) `dotnet`, drinks coffee, makes friends, and automates the world around me 🤖.

🔥 My mission is to help teams succeed while having fun, experimenting, and delivering top-shelf software products, seamlessly and effectively into production. 

🏖️ I am highly passionate about automation and DevOps practices. I work with tools like Azure, Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Azure Functions, PowerShell, and more. On top of that, I am an avid advocate for automated testing 🤖.

😍 My life's work has mainly been to rebuild and help build [Umbraco CMS](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)'s Cloud offering—Umbraco Cloud. This platform hosts thousands of websites on Microsoft Azure, enabling customers to easily start using Umbraco, and I've led multiple Cloud Teams as Team Lead.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing Umbraco Cloud with flexible hosting environments and enabling external AAD SSO for all our customers 🤓.
- 🎹 Outside of tech, I’m learning how to play the piano and stepping into the world of Data Science 🧪.
- 👯 I’m always open for a discussion about technology, coding, or the latest nerdy curiosities.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to .NET, automation, and DevOps practices.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Beyond technology, I am deeply interested in philosophy, particularly concerning the human condition and the pursuit of a fulfilling life.
