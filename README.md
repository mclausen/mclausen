# Hi there, I'm Martin Humlund Clausen 👋

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhc) • [Blog](https://dev.to/martinhc)

👋 I'm a software generalist who writes (mostly) `dotnet`, drinks coffee, makes friends, and automates the world around me 🤖

🔥 My mission is to help teams succeed while having fun, experimenting, and delivering top-shelf software products, seamlessly and effectively into production. 

🏖️ I am highly passionate about automation and DevOps practices. I work with Azure, Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, CI/CD with Github actions, Azure DevOps, Azure Functions, PowerShell, and the list goes on. On top of that, I am an avid advocate for automated testing 🤖

😍 My life's work has mainly been to rebuild and help build [Umbraco CMS](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)'s Cloud offering - Umbraco Cloud, hosting thousands of websites on Microsoft Azure, enabling customers to easily get started using Umbraco, and to steward multiple Cloud Teams as Team leads.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on bringing flexible hosting environments to Umbraco Cloud, and enabling external AAD SSO for all our customers 🤓
- 🎹 I’m currently learning how to play the piano and delve into Data Science 🧪
- 👯 I’m always up for a discussion about technology, coding, or nerdy curiosities.
- 💬 Ask me about everything .NET, automation, and DevOps practices.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhc)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Besides all the technical, I love exploring philosophy, particularly about the human condition and pursuing a fulfilling life.
